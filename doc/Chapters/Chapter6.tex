\lhead{Chapter 6. \emph{Results}}

\section{Evaluation plan}
test by hand, test with the framework -> what was easier with the
framework?
subsection: the experiment(s) that we run, detailed
\section{Configuration}
g5k, which site, maybe some more details?
\section{Experiment by hand}
steps, how much time they took
\section{Experiment using the framework}
processes used
checkpointing used
screenshots
\section{Comparison}
advantages of the framework (obvious one: no user intervention
required during the process)
results: comparison of the traces gotten (with screenshots of the
visualization) -> obviously they are very similar (right?), since both
ran the same exact experiment on the same exact nodes with the same
exact steps
