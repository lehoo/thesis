SimGrid is a generic simulation framework, which can be used to
simulate multiple kinds of distributed systems, such as
Clouds, Grids or clusters. SMPI is a framework that connects SimGrid
with the MPI inter-process communication protocol: it's part of the
SimGrid project with the goal of running MPI applications in a
simulated environment. SMPI is currently under heavy development, thus
in need of constant validation. This thesis is about the
implementation of a framework that could help in orchestrating and
automatizing tests with the goal of aiding the development of the
project. SMPI validation is done by
running real-life MPI benchmarks (using possibly multiple different
implementations), as well as running the same benchmarks with
SMPI. The results can be used to check how accurate the simulation
was. Currently, this testing process consists of multiple
manually performed steps. It's tedious, repetitive work, but as
mentioned before, it's necessary. The main goal of the framework is to
provide a means to orchestrate such tests, introducing as much
automation into the process as possible, providing the possibility to
create test workflows that could be run with minimal user
interaction. With that, we could provide the possibility to speed up
the testing process, making it possible to acquire proportionally more
test results, thus helping the development team to make progress.

The author would like to thank his supervisor, Mark Stillwell for
the opportunity to write this thesis, as well as for his counsel and
guidance throughout the project. The author would also like to
extend his thanks to George Markomanolis and Tomasz Buchert for
providing invaluable advice and selfless support when it was needed
the most.\\[0.5cm]
Last but not least, the author wants to give a very special thanks
to his family and his fiancée for their never-ending love and
support. Without them, this thesis wouldn't have been possible to
make.
