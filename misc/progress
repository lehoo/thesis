Setting up test environment on astral:
  - scp -r the NAS directory from simgrid
  - wget and compile openmpi:
    - newest version (1.7.1) doesn't compile, apparently because of XRC (eXtended Reliable Connection), which is an infiniband-specific transport

    - solution to this: version 1.7 successfully compiled, using that version
    - can't make the openmpi the default mpi implementation, as i don't have permissions to do the necessary operations for that -> will try to use full pathnames to the binaries instead
  - wget and compile pdt without problems
    - added .../pdtoolkit-3.19/x86_64/bin to PATH
  - wget and compile papi without problems
    - 1 or 2 tests failed when running 'make fulltest' and there were some warnings, but most of them were successful
  - wget and compile tau without problems
    - ./configure parameters: -prefix=/panfs/storage/home/s191080/thesis/tau-install -pdt=/panfs/storage/home/s191080/thesis/pdtoolkit-3.19/x86_64/bin -papi=/panfs/storage/home/s191080/thesis/papi-install/bin -mpiinc=/panfs/storage/home/s191080/thesis/openmpi-install/include -mpilib=/panfs/storage/home/s191080/thesis/openmpi-install/lib
    - added .../tau-install/x86_64/bin to PATH
