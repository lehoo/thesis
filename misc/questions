- introduction: what is the problem, what are we trying to accomplish
- literature review -> test frameworks: what about them? what are the aspects i could write about?
                         - smpi:
                    -> reproducible research: ???
                         - how exactly reproduce the results; why it is important
- OpenMPI/MPICH -> started looking at the code; it's hard to read; what to look for? (currently looking for: algorithms + the part where they decide which one to use)
- SMPI -> where is the part where it chooses between the implementations of the different MPI functions?
       -> structural questions
- problem description: what should I talk about in it?
- Lyon -> when can I know whether or not I can go?
- run tests: astral and smpi
